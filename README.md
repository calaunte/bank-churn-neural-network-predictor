# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains the materials and code for the "Bank Customer Churn Prediction" project, a part of the "Introduction to Neural Networks" course. The primary objective of this project is to assist the bank's operations team in identifying customers who are likely to churn by building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch.

## Project Overview

Customer retention is paramount in the competitive world of banking. An effective strategy to ensure this involves predicting which customers are likely to leave (churn) and understanding the underlying reasons. In this project, we employ an ANN to predict customer churn, providing the operations team with insights that can inform their retention strategies.

### Objectives

- **Data Preparation**: Cleanse and prepare customer banking data for neural network integration.
- **Building an ANN**: Construct and train an artificial neural network from scratch that can predict the likelihood of customer churn.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model's accuracy and efficiency in predicting churn.
- **Operational Insight**: Provide actionable strategies based on the model's output to improve customer retention efforts.

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of neural networks.
- Python environment (preferably Anaconda) with libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras).
